# Helsinki Café

Helsinki Café needed a website that matched their warm, inviting atmosphere while providing practical information for customers. The site features:

- Mobile-friendly design for customers on the go
- Easy-to-update menu section
- Online reservation system
- Location map and opening hours
- Photo gallery showcasing their space and offerings

The site was built with performance in mind, loading quickly even on slower mobile connections. It's also easy for the staff to update content without technical knowledge.
