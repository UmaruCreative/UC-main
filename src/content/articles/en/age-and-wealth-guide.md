# Financial Milestones by Age: A Quick Savings Guide

It’s natural to check your savings and wonder: *Am I on track for my age?* While everyone’s financial journey is unique, having some benchmarks can help you see if you’re broadly on track.  

One useful reference comes from the US Federal Reserve’s data on median net worth (excluding housing). Different countries and lifestyles mean these numbers aren’t absolute, but they provide a **helpful anchor** for planning.

## Your 20s: Build Habits First

- **Typical net worth (mid-20s):** around **$19,000**  
- Focus on **developing good financial habits** rather than amassing wealth instantly:  
  - Save consistently: 5–15% of income.  
  - Build an emergency fund.  
  - Pay off high-interest debts, including credit cards.  
  - Start budgeting to track real income and spending.  

Consistency and habit-building at this stage create a strong foundation for future wealth growth.

## Your 30s: Grow and Invest

- **Early 30s:** about **$36,000**  
- **Late 30s:** around **$43,000**  
- Aim to have saved **1–2× your annual salary** by this stage.  
- Key priorities:  
  - Invest with a long-term mindset (low-cost index funds, diversified portfolios).  
  - Avoid borrowing from retirement accounts.  
  - Maintain a healthy savings rate (15–20% of pre-tax income) to support retirement plans.  

## Your 40s: Maximise Income, Keep Discipline

- **Early 40s:** roughly **$57,000**  
- **Late 40s:** around **$92,000**  
- Target: **2–4× your annual salary** in retirement savings.  
- This is often your peak earning decade:  
  - Focus on maximising income while controlling lifestyle inflation.  
  - Maintain and review your budget regularly.  
  - Plan investments to grow wealth steadily over the next 20 years.  

## Your 50s: Fine-Tune and Prepare

- **Early 50s:** about **$94,000**  
- **Late 50s:** around **$130,000**  
- Goal: **5–7× your salary** by mid-50s.  
- Actions:  
  - Review and adjust your retirement plan.  
  - Reassess expected expenses, including healthcare and lifestyle changes.  
  - Consider savings rate and investment mix to ensure you’re on track.  

## Your 60s: Transition and Sustain

- **Early 60s:** around **$140,000**  
- **Late 60s:** roughly **$130,000** (balances typically decline as retirement begins)  
- Aim for **10× your annual salary** by retirement.  
- Focus on sustainable withdrawals while balancing pensions, savings, and lifestyle choices.  
- Adapt to changing income streams and ensure long-term financial security.

💡 **Takeaway**  
These figures are **guidelines, not strict rules**. Your location, housing situation, family structure, and personal goals all influence the right target for you. The key is to start early, save consistently, and adjust as life unfolds — your future self will thank you.
