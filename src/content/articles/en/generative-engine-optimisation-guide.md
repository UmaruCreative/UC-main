# Navigating the AI Search Shift: Your Practical Guide to Generative Engine Optimisation (GEO)

If you’ve noticed that your website traffic isn’t quite what it used to be, you’re not alone. Around the world, many businesses are finding that familiar SEO tactics are no longer bringing the same results.  

The reason? The rise of generative AI tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude. Search is changing quickly, and **Generative Engine Optimisation (GEO)** is becoming just as important as traditional SEO.  

Based here in Finland, I see this shift up close when working with small businesses and independent professionals across the Nordics. This article is a practical guide to help you prepare for the future of search.

## What is Generative Engine Optimisation (GEO)?

In short, GEO is about making sure your business can be found when people search using AI tools.  

Instead of simply ranking on a results page, your brand may now appear directly in AI-generated answers. For that to happen, AI needs to understand and recognise your business as a trusted “entity”.  

It’s a big shift, but the good news is: there are clear steps you can take to adapt.

## Practical Steps to Strengthen Your GEO

### 1. Build a Consistent Digital Footprint  
AI tools cross-check your presence across the web. Make sure your details are accurate and consistent everywhere.  

- **Google Business Profile and Apple Maps**: Keep your address, opening hours, and links updated.  
- **Social Media**: Maintain active, professional profiles on platforms your audience uses.  
- **Consistency**: Ensure your name, phone, and other details are identical across platforms.  

Every trace of your business helps AI confirm that you are a legitimate entity.

### 2. Use Structured Data (Schema.org)  
Structured data is a way of labelling the information on your site so that AI understands it better.  

- **Schema.org Markup**: Add code that defines details like your services, location, and founder.  
- **Go Beyond Basics**: Include links to social media, company history, and more.  
- **Templates Available**: Google offers ready-to-use examples for most business types.  

As a web designer, I often help clients set this up so AI can “read” their site with clarity.

### 3. Share Content Widely and Smartly  
AI engines crawl more than just websites. They scan platforms like Medium, Reddit, LinkedIn, and YouTube for answers.  

- **Repurpose Content**: Turn a blog post into a podcast episode, LinkedIn post, or short video.  
- **Keep Active**: Regular, thoughtful sharing helps AI “notice” you more often.  

Think of it as spreading your message where AI is most likely to listen.

### 4. Value of Backlinks and Press Still Stands  
Even in the AI era, backlinks and press coverage remain powerful signals.  

- **High-Authority Links**: A feature in a respected publication can strengthen both SEO and GEO.  
- **Press Releases**: Announcements about launches, events, or milestones are useful for visibility.  

These connections help your brand stay credible and easy for AI to reference.

## Preparing for the Future of Search  

GEO isn’t a passing trend. It’s about ensuring your business continues to be seen, trusted, and remembered in an AI-first world.  

For small businesses and independent professionals, now is the time to adapt. Taking small, steady steps will help your brand stay visible — both to people and to AI.
