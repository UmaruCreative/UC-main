# Meta launches Vibes: AI-generated short videos as a new experiment

Meta has unveiled a new platform called **Vibes**, where every short video is generated by AI. Unlike TikTok or Instagram Reels, this isn’t about people mixing AI with personal footage — the idea here is *pure AI entertainment*.

## What is Vibes?

Vibes lets users type in a text prompt and instantly generate a short video.  
The platform also includes a **Mix** feature, allowing people to remix existing AI videos, adjust scenes, swap backgrounds, add soundtracks, or build on someone else’s creation.

Content can stay within the Vibes app or be shared directly to Instagram Stories or Facebook Reels.


## Why create a separate platform?

Meta’s reasoning is simple: rather than flooding Facebook and Instagram with endless AI clips, it makes sense to test AI-only content in its own space.  

This also sets clearer boundaries — where human-created and AI-generated content sit side by side, but not mixed in the same feed.


## How Vibes differs from other AI video generators

Most AI video generators focus on producing polished videos from text or images, giving creators detailed control over quality and style. Vibes, in contrast, is built around a social feed of AI clips, where every video can be discovered, shared, and remixed.

The platform emphasises quick, playful experimentation rather than perfect output. Users can change visuals, swap backgrounds, add music, or build on someone else’s clip directly in the feed. It’s less about professional production and more about engaging with AI content socially and creatively.


## Opportunities and questions

The launch raises interesting possibilities:  
- Fast, low-cost video creation for anyone with an idea.  
- New creative formats built around remixing rather than starting from scratch.  
- A potential new digital playground for younger audiences used to experimenting with trends.  


But it also surfaces some questions:

1.If everything is AI, where does originality come from?  
2.How will people feel about consuming content with no human behind the camera?  
3.What happens to trust and authenticity when AI is the main storyteller?  


## My take

This move shows how far AI has shifted from “assisting” to becoming the centrepiece of creative platforms. For me, the most intriguing part isn’t whether Vibes succeeds as a product, but what it signals:  

- Content will increasingly be **generated first, curated later**.  
- Remixing and reusing will feel more natural than starting from a blank page.  
- We may soon see online spaces where AI and humans don’t just coexist, but create and interact with each other on equal terms.  


## Takeaway

Vibes may or may not become the next TikTok, but it does mark a turning point. As digital spaces experiment with AI-only content, the question is not *if* AI will shape online creativity, but *how*.
