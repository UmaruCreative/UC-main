Anthropic has released its first **AI Economic Usage Index** — a detailed look at how people across the US and globally are using Claude.  
The findings are not just numbers; they reveal where AI is starting to become everyday infrastructure, and where adoption remains uneven.

## Automation is gaining ground  
In less than a year, the share of one-shot “instructional” use rose from **27% to 39%**.  
For the first time, automation slightly overtook augmentation.  
This shift suggests growing trust in AI to complete tasks with minimal input.

## Usage mirrors local economies  
Patterns vary widely:  
- Hawaiians turn to Claude for **travel planning**.  
- Massachusetts leans on it for **scientific research**.  
- In India, usage is strong around **building web apps**.  

Everywhere, software engineering leads — but each region has its own *signature dish*.  
This underlines how AI adapts within existing industries and local needs.

## Unequal adoption  
Wealthier countries are not only using AI more, but also in more diverse ways.  
Per capita leaders include **Israel, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, and South Korea**.  
The report warns: as with electricity or engines, AI could boost productivity while widening global inequality.

## Enterprises vs individuals  
Enterprises using Anthropic’s API show a clear pattern: **77% of tasks are automated**, often with minimal human oversight.  
In contrast, individuals balance automation with collaboration.  
It seems businesses already see AI less as a helper and more as infrastructure.

## Final thoughts  
What struck me most is how AI diffusion is both faster and more uneven than past technologies. For me, the surprise is not just in where AI shows up, but in how broadly people already apply it beyond coding. In the end, the value isn’t in AI doing everything, but in freeing up space for the work that needs judgment, creativity, or simply a human connection.
