Gaming isn’t just entertainment anymore—it’s a powerful engine for culture, connection, and commerce. Yet according to a new report from **Dentsu Gaming**, brands are still slow to invest in this space.  

With more than **3.5 billion gamers worldwide** and gaming time increasing **6% year-on-year**, it’s surprising that global media spend on gaming accounts for **less than 5%**.  

Here’s what this means for brands and digital experiences.

### Gaming: Culture and Commerce Combined
Games today are more than pixels and consoles—they influence film, TV, and even daily life. In 2024, over **60 game-inspired films and series** were produced, with at least **44 more projects expected in 2025**.  

Take Warner Bros.’ **Minecraft movie** as an example. The film earned nearly **$1 billion globally**, but more impressively, it boosted **daily active Minecraft players by 17% in just one week**. Gaming content drives engagement far beyond the screen.

### The Takeaway
*Understanding gaming trends is a great place to start. They reveal a simple truth: while billions of people play, connect, and spend time in gaming worlds, brands still invest less than 5% of media budgets here. That gap is more than just a statistic—it’s an opportunity. For marketers, the lesson is clear: gaming isn’t a niche; it’s a mainstream channel where culture, community, and commerce meet. The brands that act now will be the ones building real connections with the audiences of tomorrow.*
