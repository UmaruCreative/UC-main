# The Easiest Prompt Formula to 10x Your Results

AI tools are everywhere—but one truth never changes:  
**You only get great answers if you ask great questions.**

The good news? You don’t need to be technical or learn advanced logic.  
All you need is one simple framework: **RICECO**.  

Six prompt ingredients that, when used correctly, can change how you work, create, and communicate. You won’t need all six every time, so we’ll look at them in order of importance. At the end, you’ll also get a **condensed 3-step version** that works for 80% of cases.  

And yes, this works in *any* large language model—ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Grok, or anything else.

## The RICECO Framework

**RICECO** stands for:  
- **R**ole  
- **I**nstruction  
- **C**ontext  
- **E**xamples  
- **C**onstraints  
- **O**utput format  

Let’s go through each.

---

### 1. Role  
Assigning a role instantly changes the tone, perspective, and depth of the response.  

**Example – Sleep Advice**  
- No role: *“Get better sleep by avoiding screens, going to bed early…”* (generic)  
- Role = sleep doctor: evidence-based, medical precision  
- Role = tired parent: conversational, relatable, emotionally tuned  

Same task, completely different results—because of the role.

---

### 2. Instruction  
This is the core task. What exactly do you want the AI to do?  

Bad prompt:  
> Write me an engaging YouTube short about prompting tips.  

Better prompt:  
> Write a 60-second YouTube short script about prompting tips using a curiosity-gap hook and a strong visual anchor.  

Be **specific, direct, and clear**. Replace vague words like *“engaging”* or *“interesting”* with defined instructions.

---

### 3. Context  
Most skipped, but most powerful. Context is the background that makes the response relevant.  

Bad prompt:  
> Write a 500-word blog post about AI video tools.  

Better prompt:  
> Write a 500-word blog post about AI video tools **for small business owners** who want to turn podcasts into YouTube shorts. The goal is to explain the value in **simple, practical terms**.  

Who is it for? What’s the scenario? Why does it matter? Context answers those questions.

---

### 4. Examples  
One of the biggest shortcuts. Provide the AI with a reference to model tone, structure, or format.  

For instance, if drafting a newsletter, include a past issue and say:  
> Use this as a reference for tone and format.  

Even a single strong example can dramatically improve results.

---

### 5. Constraints  
Set boundaries so the model avoids bad habits like vagueness or wordiness.  

Examples:  
- Keep under 100 words  
- Avoid buzzwords like *innovative*  
- Use a warm, conversational tone  
- Include one stat in the first paragraph  

Constraints = efficiency. They save editing time later.

---

### 6. Output Format  
How do you want the answer structured?  

Instead of a wall of text, ask:  
> Present this as a 3-column table with name, features, and ideal use cases.  

Formats could be: bullet points, JSON, markdown headers, tweet thread, script, flowchart… you decide.

---

## Putting It All Together

Let’s take a weak prompt:  
> How can I implement AI in my real estate business?  

Using **RICECO**:  
- **Role:** You are a business strategist specializing in AI adoption.  
- **Instruction:** Identify AI opportunities and produce a prioritized action plan.  
- **Context:** Real estate agency with limited time and $400 budget.  
- **Examples:** List of sample automation ideas.  
- **Constraints:** Must be low-maintenance, non-technical.  
- **Output format:** A 3-part action plan (quick wins, core systems, long-term growth).  

The result? A customized, actionable plan—not generic advice.

---

## The Condensed ICC Formula

For quick prompts, you don’t always need all six. Most of the time, just three are enough:  

- **I**nstruction – What exactly do you want?  
- **C**ontext – Who is it for? Why does it matter?  
- **C**onstraints – Any must-haves or boundaries.  

That’s the **ICC formula**.  

**Example:**  
Bad:  
> Write a Twitter post about ChatGPT tips.  

Better:  
> Write a Twitter thread with 5 lessons I’ve learned from using ChatGPT daily. Audience = indie creators. Make it clear, casual, non-technical. No hashtags.  

Clean, clear, effective.

---

## From Good to Great: EIO  

Once you get your output, don’t stop. Use **EIO**:  
- **Evaluate** – Does it fit the goal? Anything missing?  
- **Iterate** – Ask the model to rewrite, expand, shorten, or shift tone.  
- **Optimize** – Refine your prompt so it’s sharper and reusable.  

This turns prompting into a repeatable system.

---

## Final Thoughts

Prompting isn’t about being technical. It’s about being **clear, specific, and intentional**.  

The **RICECO framework** gives you six levers to pull.  
The **ICC shortcut** covers 80% of use cases.  
And with **EIO**, you keep improving over time.  

The way you prompt shapes everything that comes after. Strong prompts mean faster workflows, better content, and consistently higher-quality results.
