# A First Taste of Finland: From Dairy to Agriculture

*From creamy yogurt to sweet buns, I’ve been discovering how Finland’s milk, berries, and farming traditions shape its unique food culture.*

### Creamy Discoveries: Jogurtti and Pasha

Soon after arriving in Finland, I had my first taste of Finnish jogurtti—a thick, tangy yogurt, often flavoured with berries like mansikka (strawberry). It reminded me of French-style Yoplait but richer, creamier, and with a naturally fresh taste.

Then came Pasha during Easter. One bite, and I was amazed. This creamy dessert made from quark, butter, eggs, and cream reminded me of cheesecake, but even more indulgent. Infused with lemon, vanilla, or dried fruits, Pasha became an instant favourite.

### I Learned Something New: Milk Has Seasons!

Here’s something I didn’t expect to learn: **milk changes flavour with the seasons.**

From December to April, the cows drink less water due to the cold, making winter milk richer. Come May and June, as the cows graze freely on fresh grass, the flavour becomes lighter and fresher. In hot summer months (July to September), cows drink more water, slightly diluting the milk’s intensity. Then in the cooler autumn (October to November), the milk becomes rich again.

This natural cycle is one of the secrets behind Finland’s deeply flavourful dairy products.

### Berries, Fields, and the Midnight Sun

I was also fascinated to learn how Finland’s unique climate shapes its crops. Up north, the Midnight Sun brings nearly 24 hours of daylight in summer, allowing vegetables and berries to grow with intense flavour and sweetness. This is why Finnish berries—like cloudberries and bilberries—taste so vibrant.

For a pastry lover like me, this is paradise. These berries aren’t just delicious; they are nature’s perfect filling for tarts, buns, and cakes.

### Looking Forward: Pastry, People, and Local Producers

Tasting Finnish pastries like pulla (cardamom sweet bread) and munkki (doughnuts) has only deepened my curiosity. I hope to visit more farmers’ markets, meet local producers, and learn how their stories and practices shape the flavours I love.

Finland’s dairy and agriculture are not just about food—they reflect the rhythm of nature and the care of those who work the land. And for me, that makes every bite more meaningful.
