# Attraction Marketing: Notes from Chris’s Business Psychology Masterclass  

I recently watched <u>[Chris Do’s *Marketing Strategies To Grow Your Business+Brand* masterclass on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiyNGOIbwcE)</u>, and it gave me a clearer perspective on one of the biggest challenges we face as creatives and small business owners:  

👉 *Should I focus on chasing clients through outreach, or should I build content that attracts them to me?*  

Chris calls the middle ground **attraction marketing**, and here are the key notes I took away.  

---

## Direct Sales vs. Content Marketing  

Chris explains that there are two ends of the spectrum:  

- **Direct sales** → Clear, specific, and transactional.  
  - Example: “I do this. If you need help, let’s talk now.”  
  - Works quickly, but you’re always in chase mode.  

- **Content marketing** → Sharing insights, ideas, or inspiration with no hard selling.  
  - Builds goodwill, authority, and trust over time.  
  - But it’s slow, and it doesn’t guarantee immediate results.  

Both work—but if you only stick to one side, you risk burning out or being ignored.

## The Hybrid: Attraction Marketing  

This is where the two worlds meet.  

- Create **content so valuable someone might even pay for it**.  
- Share part of it for free to spark curiosity.  
- Offer the deeper version (a guide, template, or resource) to those who engage.  
- Follow up with genuine conversations—not pressure.  

This way, people invite *you* into the conversation, instead of feeling chased.

## Why It Resonates  

What stood out to me most was how **permission-based** this approach feels.  

- It lets people self-select.  
- It proves your expertise upfront.  
- It builds trust step by step, instead of forcing a pitch.  

It made me think: in web design, I don’t just want to win a project—I want to earn long-term trust. Attraction marketing feels aligned with that.

## When to Lean Which Way  

Chris also pointed out that timing matters:  

- If you need **clients fast**, lean more on direct outreach.  
- If you’re building for the **long run**, invest in content and authority.  
- For most of us, the smart path is a **hybrid**.  

This was a good reminder for me—sometimes I get caught up in “should I do outreach or should I just post content?” But it’s not either/or. It’s about balance.

## Final Note  

What I liked about Chris’s framing is that it’s not just about *getting more*. It’s about **doing better work for the right audience**, and letting that create momentum. Over time, attraction marketing compounds into something transformational, not just transactional.  

If you’re interested in these ideas, I highly recommend watching the full talk:
