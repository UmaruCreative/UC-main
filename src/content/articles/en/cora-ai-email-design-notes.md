# When Design Feels Like a Place: Lessons from Cora, the AI Email Assistant


### A calm inbox that feels like fresh air

Imagine opening your email and feeling *relieved*.  
That’s the idea behind **Cora**, an AI email assistant that turns Gmail into something closer to an art gallery than an office tool.  

With soft, Midjourney-style skies as backgrounds and painterly textures behind each message, Cora helps you manage emails — sorting, drafting replies, and archiving automatically — while keeping the space visually calm. It’s like breathing fresh air after a long meeting.

## Building places, not products

The team behind Cora wrote a piece called *“Build Places, Not Products”*, and it captures something often forgotten in digital design.  

Most SaaS tools start from features, and design comes later. Cora flips that: **design leads the process**.  
It doesn’t aim to just *look nice* — it’s designed to *feel different*.  

When sameness becomes cheap, *difference becomes valuable*.  
Cora’s design borrows not just from app trends, but from **film, architecture, fashion, and games**. The result: a workspace that doesn’t just function — it transforms how you feel while working.

## The product as a space

Scrolling in Cora doesn’t feel like moving through a list. It feels like walking through a textured hall, where light, motion and rhythm are deliberate.  
The small friction added to scrolling makes you slow down — focusing on one thing at a time.  

If you imagine the interface as a *place* rather than a *screen*, everything changes. It’s not just buttons and panels — it’s air, distance, and atmosphere.  
The team describes this as designing **spatial emotion** — building tools that feel like environments, not spreadsheets.

## When atmosphere becomes the moat

In a world where AI can generate perfect layouts in seconds, the human edge may come from something subtler — **atmosphere**.  

- Tools get the job done.  
- But *places* invite you to stay.  

That’s what Cora achieves: it turns the daily act of reading emails into something calmer and more mindful. It reminds us that beyond efficiency, people crave beauty, rhythm, and a sense of space — even inside a browser tab.

## Takeaway

Cora shows that design isn’t just about usability; it’s about creating an emotional climate where people feel more human.  
As AI tools become more uniform, the next differentiation may not come from features, but from **how a product makes people feel while using it**.  

When building the web, perhaps we should all ask a simple question first:  
*What should it feel like to be here?*
