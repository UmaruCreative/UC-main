Not so long ago, creators and small businesses reached people directly through their own websites. They used simple tools like email lists and RSS feeds. It was personal, direct, and reliable.  

Then platforms promised something easier. Many of us moved in, hoping for stronger connections and a bigger reach. But the reality has been quite different.

## What the comic reminds us of
- **At the start**: Our websites were the home base. People subscribed because they wanted to hear from us.  
- **With platforms**: Convenience drew us in, but also put our work under someone else’s control.  
- **Now**: Reaching the very people who chose to follow often costs money.  

It’s a gentle but clear reminder: when you build on rented ground, the rules can change overnight.

## A thought for small businesses
If you run a café in Helsinki or a consultancy in Stockholm, it might feel like social media is the only way to keep in touch. Yet your website and newsletter are the channels you truly own.  

They don’t depend on algorithms, promotions, or sudden design changes. They are steady spaces where your story and your work stay yours.

## Takeaway
Social media can be useful, but it shouldn’t replace your home base. Your website is still the place where people can find you — directly, freely, and without limits set by someone else.
