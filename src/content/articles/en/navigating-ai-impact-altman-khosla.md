Artificial intelligence is moving fast. In a recent conversation, Sam Altman (CEO of OpenAI) and Venod Khosla (venture capitalist) explored what might happen in the next 18 months and beyond.  
They touched on software, jobs, research, and society at large. Here are some of the most relevant points — with reflections for professionals and small businesses.

## The Pace of Change

Altman compared the release of ChatGPT to a “zero to one” moment: a sudden leap that shocked the world. Since then, he sees progress as having moved from “one to ten.” The next stage — possibly “ten to one hundred” — could arrive in the next 18 months.  

The surprise may feel less dramatic this time, but the underlying impact could be much greater. For businesses, this means adapting steadily, rather than waiting for another headline-grabbing breakthrough.

## Shifts in Software and Companies

Much of the discussion focused on how AI could reshape software. Altman described a future where people simply type a request, and AI generates software on demand.  
If that becomes reality, entire SaaS companies might lose relevance. The Fortune 500 of the 2030s could look very different.  

In the nearer term, the first wave of disruption is likely in:  
- **Software development**  
- **Customer support**  
- **Sales**  

Some companies are already moving quickly here. For small businesses, the opportunity lies in adopting these tools early to stay efficient and competitive.

## AI and Scientific Discovery

AI is also expected to accelerate research. Altman suggested a gradual shift: today AI might generate code or test ideas; tomorrow it could propose new hypotheses or design experiments.  

The distinction between “AI helping humans” and “humans helping AI” may blur. What matters is the speed. If research output increases tenfold, industries from medicine to energy could be transformed far sooner than expected.

## Equity and Global Access

Another theme was access. AI could concentrate wealth in a few companies, or it could make advanced tools widely available. Altman leaned towards the latter, pointing out how services like ChatGPT already reach hundreds of millions of people.  

He imagined a world where everyone can request software, receive high-quality education, or get medical advice at little to no cost. At the same time, he noted potential risks, such as limited availability of computing power — which could become a bottleneck if not managed wisely.

## What This Means in Practice

For independent professionals and small businesses, these insights are not predictions to follow blindly. They are signals of change.  
Some practical responses could be:  
- Test AI tools in areas that already take time or resources.  
- Keep an eye on how clients’ expectations shift as they use AI themselves.  
- Reflect on where human judgement and creativity remain essential in your work.  

The aim is not to chase every trend, but to stay flexible enough to adjust as new capabilities emerge.

### Closing Thought

Altman and Khosla’s conversation highlighted both disruption and possibility. The next 18 months may not bring another “shock moment,” but the pace of progress is unlikely to slow.  

For small businesses and independent professionals, the challenge is clear: remain open, experiment thoughtfully, and focus on the parts of your work where you bring lasting value.
