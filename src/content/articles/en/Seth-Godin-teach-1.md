I recently watched a talk by<u>[Seth Godin – *Everything You (probably) DON’T Know About Marketing*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPK_qzeH_yk&pp=ygU2RXZlcnl0aGluZyBZb3UgKHByb2JhYmx5KSBET07igJlUIEtub3cgQWJvdXQgTWFya2V0aW5n)</u> and wanted to share a few takeaways that resonated deeply with me as a web designer.  

When I design websites, I think about who will use them, the audience they need to speak to, the goals of my client, and of course the look and feel. But Seth’s perspective reminded me of something bigger: design is also about **making a distinct promise and connecting with the right people**.

### A Logo Isn’t a Brand
Seth Godin makes a crucial point: a logo is not a brand. A hotel like Hyatt might have a logo, but if all their signs were swapped, most customers wouldn’t notice. That’s because the logo alone doesn’t carry a promise.  

Nike, on the other hand, does more than show a symbol. It makes a clear promise that sets expectations and creates loyalty. Customers know what to expect next time—and they’re willing to pay more for that unique value. That’s the essence of a brand: avoiding the trap of competing solely on price.  

For web design, this means a website shouldn’t just be a “digital business card.” It should clearly communicate the promise behind the brand.

### Who It’s For, What It’s For
Great marketing—and by extension, great design—isn’t about pleasing everyone. It’s about clarity: *who is it for, and what is it for?*  

Godin stresses the importance of focusing on the **smallest viable group**—the specific people who will actually care. This requires moving beyond demographics (age, income) into **psychographics** (beliefs, dreams, desires).  

For me, this is a reminder to design with empathy. A good website isn’t generic—it resonates with the right audience and gives them a sense of belonging.

### Better, Not More
We live in a culture that chases clicks, likes, and more numbers. Godin warns against this trap. He draws a distinction:  

- **Direct marketing** is measurable and focused on short-term responses (ads, clicks, conversions).  
- **Brand marketing** is less measurable, but it builds long-term trust and tells “the story of who you are.”  

Both matter, but if you only chase what’s measurable, you risk being seen as a commodity. Instead, the compass should be **better, not more**: doing meaningful work for a clearly defined group—even if it’s less measurable.  

For web design, that means creating intentional, thoughtful websites that serve the right people well, rather than chasing broad traffic or empty metrics.

### Final Thought
For me, these ideas are a reminder that web design isn’t just about creating something that looks good—it’s about building a brand presence that earns trust and loyalty. That’s the real privilege of this work.
