Microsoft has just launched its first fully in-house AI models, **MAI-Voice-1** and **MAI-1-preview**. Until now, the company relied heavily on OpenAI. This change could affect how AI tools appear in the software many small businesses already use daily.

## What has been released
- **MAI-Voice-1**: A speech generation model that can produce one minute of speech in less than a second. It’s already live in Copilot Daily and Podcasts.  
- **MAI-1-preview**: A text-based model designed for instruction following and everyday queries. It’s still being tested before wider rollout.  

According to Microsoft’s CEO Mustafa Suleyman, the text model is “up there with some of the best in the world”. Benchmarks aren’t public yet, so we’ll have to wait and see.

## Why this matters for small businesses
AI is becoming a natural part of tools like Office, Teams, and Copilot. Microsoft building its own models means:
- **More direct control**: Features may evolve faster without waiting on partners.  
- **Closer integration**: Expect smoother AI features inside Microsoft products.  
- **Competition in AI**: More players building models can mean better options long-term.  

For small shops, cafés, or consultancies, this could show up as smarter scheduling in Outlook, easier text drafting in Word, or more natural voice features in Teams.


## Takeaway
Microsoft moving into its own AI development may sound distant, but it could shape the everyday tools you already rely on. Keeping an eye on these changes helps you plan how to use AI in your business — without getting caught off guard.
